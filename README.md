If you are not provided with the API keys, you'll have to set up your Google Oauth, as well as a mongoDB database, as well as create your own Categories data, which contains a name and a image address directed to the img sub folder in the public folder.The sample categories used are 'Chinese', 'Thai', 'Japanese', 'Indian' and 'Malay', which you should follow to avoid confusion if you are not familiar with the code.
